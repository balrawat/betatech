My name is **Balvinder Singh Rawat**, and this is my personal blog. It currently has {{ site.posts | size }} posts in {{ site.categories | size }} categories which combinedly have {{ total_words }} words, which will take an average reader ({{ site.wpm }} WPM) approximately <span class="time">{{ total_readtime }}</span> minutes to read. {% if featuredcount != 0 %}There are <a href="{{ site.url }}/featured">{{ featuredcount }} featured posts</a>, you should definitely check those out.{% endif %} The most recent post is {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% if post.description %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% else %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}" title="Read more about {{ post.title }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% endif %}{% endfor %} which was published on {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% assign modifiedtime = post.modified | date: "%Y%m%d" %}{% assign posttime = post.date | date: "%Y%m%d" %}<time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" class="post-time">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% if post.modified %}{% if modifiedtime != posttime %} and last modified on <time datetime="{{ post.modified | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}" itemprop="dateModified">{{ post.modified | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}.

***Engineer***  
Inventor  

I
make
stuff.


*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*


I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*


But over the years, I noticed that somehow, along the way, software designed to help us be creative, actually made us less creative. That's because we believe our best ideas emerge when we use pencils and paper.
So I set out to build tools that work the way I do.


Tools for the creative space — the 53 centimeters that magically link head, heart, and hand. Tools as simple as pencil and paper. Tools so essential, I  really can't imagine work without them.


For
the makers,  
the creators,  
the discoverers,  
the original thinkers,  
***This is the space to create.***
