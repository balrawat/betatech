The bash _**history**_ command is very cool. I understand why it shows the line numbers, but sometimes we need only the commands & not the numbers e.g. when we need to copy & run the commands to another server or terminal then it gets quiet useful. When you run **_history_** , the output is similar to this:

Now try running **_history | cut -c 8-_** , you'll get the this:

So this command is really useful in situations where you need to do repeated work on same or different servers & you don't have scripting knowledge. You can just copy & paste the commands.Â
