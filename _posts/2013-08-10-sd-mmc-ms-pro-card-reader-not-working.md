Not sure how many of you've come across this, but for me this was unusual. Usually Ubuntu has great compatibility built out of the box. All the wifi,graphics etc are picked on boot. But when I inserted my SD card on its slot, it was not recognized & I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with 3.9.2 kernel. But it was simple google search & I found a simple solution for this problem:-

  

Create the file "sdhci-pci.conf" that contains one single line "options sdhci debug_quirks=0x40" in a directory "/etc/modprobe.d"  
  
root@infra:/etc/modprobe.d# cat ./sdhci-pci.conf  
options sdhci debug_quirks=0x40  
  
and then reload the modules:  
  
root@infra:/etc/modprobe.d# rmmod sdhci-pci  
root@infra:/etc/modprobe.d# rmmod sdhci  
root@infra:/etc/modprobe.d# modprobe sdhci-pci  
  
(or reboot)  
  
and plug-in the SD card now, it works...

  

I'm Happy again...

  

Hope it helps you too..
