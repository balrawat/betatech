**What is LINUX?**

  

Technically speaking, Linux is the Kernel; the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating systems: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

  

Its under developement since 1991, started by Linus Torvalds.

*   Open-source (Completely customizable)
*   Portable to nearly any hardware platform
*   Highly scalable to lots of cores, or lots of memory
*   Highly efficient, therefore useful for computaion
*   Robust and proven security model
